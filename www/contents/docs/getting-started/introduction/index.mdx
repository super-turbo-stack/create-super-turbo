## What is Create Super Turbo?

Unlike various CLI tools, Create Super Turbo (CST) is designed to simplify setting up full-stack TurboRepo projects that are blazing fast. It's not overly opinionated about how to start your project, leaving much of the control in your hands while guiding you through a few key setup steps. CST focuses on rapid prototyping, supporting React, Next.js, and Express.

The CLI options allow you to quickly configure a typesafe project with your preferred package manager, navigation, styling, and authentication. Whether you're building front-end or full-stack applications, CST helps you efficiently set up modern architectures with TurboRepo for workspace management and performance optimization.

## Apps and Dependencies

CST supports React, Next.js, and Express. It also supports the following dependencies for these apps:

- **React** - React Router, Tanstack Query, Recoil, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn-UI
- **Next** - Next-Auth, Prisma Tanstack Query, Recoil, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn-UI
- **Express** - Prisma and CORS

More dependencies will be added in the future. If you have a specific app or dependency in mind, please [open an issue](https://github.com/super-turbo-stack/create-super-turbo/issues/new/choose) and we'll prioritize it.
